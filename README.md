# Bike-Rental-System
BikeBook is an online bike rental system. A company named bikebook offers multiple categories of bikes for rent for people around the country. So we have designed an application from where the customer can register to rent their desirable bike or bicycle for a specific time.
This is a simple web-based open source software written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React) and Nodejs.

# Purpose
From the BikeBook people would be able to rent the bike from a specific renting point. And they can rent the bike for that specific time period and after their use, they can submit the bike on some specific points. This will solve many problems. Now people do need to avoid owning a bike to ride. They can rent a bike and ride as much as they want. This will also benefit traffic management. As a two-wheeled vehicle is less prone to create traffic jams.
